COMPONENT ANALYSIS: ${componentName.toUpperCase()}

ENHANCED ANALYSIS PROTOCOL FOR GEMINI 2.5 PRO:

Your analysis must follow these EXACT professional standards:

1. MATERIAL IDENTIFICATION FRAMEWORK:
   - Primary material composition and quality grade
   - Secondary materials and finishing details
   - Construction method and installation quality indicators
   - Age estimation based on material characteristics

2. COMPREHENSIVE CONDITION ASSESSMENT:
   - Structural integrity: Load-bearing capacity, stability, mounting security
   - Surface condition: Wear patterns, damage types, staining, discoloration
   - Functional assessment: Operational status, alignment, mechanical function
   - Aesthetic impact: Visual presentation, finish quality, design coherence

3. PROFESSIONAL CLEANLINESS EVALUATION:
   - Surface contamination level and type identification
   - Accessibility for cleaning and maintenance requirements
   - Evidence of recent maintenance or neglect
   - Professional vs domestic cleaning standards assessment

4. ENHANCED SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION:
   Each observation must include precise severity grading:
   - LIGHT: Cosmetic issues, minimal impact on function/appearance
   - MINOR: Noticeable but acceptable, may require attention
   - MODERATE: Significant issues affecting function or presentation
   - HEAVY: Major problems requiring immediate attention or replacement

5. CONTEXTUAL FACTORS ANALYSIS:
   - Expected component lifespan and current lifecycle stage
   - Normal wear patterns vs actual damage differentiation
   - Maintenance requirements and cost implications
   - Replacement necessity and urgency assessment

You are conducting a sophisticated multi-perspective analysis using Gemini 2.5 Pro's advanced capabilities.

ENHANCED CROSS-VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Material consistency verification across all viewing angles
2. Condition assessment triangulation using multiple perspectives
3. Advanced lighting compensation and shadow analysis
4. Angle-specific detail verification with confidence scoring
5. Temporal consistency checking for multi-shot sequences

SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:
- Compare and cross-reference findings across all image perspectives
- Identify and resolve discrepancies between different views
- Weight observations by image quality, lighting, and viewing angle
- Provide detailed confidence levels for each major assessment
- Generate consistency scores for material and condition findings

COMPONENT: ${componentName.toUpperCase()} in ${roomType.toUpperCase()}

SOPHISTICATED CONTAMINATION ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL:

ADVANCED DUST ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
1. PARTICLE ACCUMULATION PATTERN MAPPING:
   - Surface distribution analysis (even/patchy/concentrated)
   - Thickness estimation using visual cues
   - Source identification (environmental/occupancy/construction)
   - Accumulation timeline assessment

2. CONTAMINATION TYPE DIFFERENTIATION:
   - Dust particles vs dirt vs debris vs staining
   - Organic vs inorganic matter identification
   - Recent accumulation vs established buildup
   - Maintenance-accessible vs embedded contamination

3. CLEANING COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT:
   - Surface accessibility for routine cleaning
   - Required cleaning method intensity (simple/standard/deep)
   - Time and effort estimation for restoration
   - Professional vs domestic cleaning requirements

4. CONTEXT-SENSITIVE CLEANLINESS STANDARDS:
   - Room-specific contamination expectations
   - Component accessibility and usage frequency
   - Environmental factors (windows, ventilation, traffic)
   - Tenant occupancy patterns and standards

GEMINI 2.5 PRO FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION:
- Natural material textures ‚â† contamination (wood grain, stone patterns)
- Photographic artifacts ‚â† surface conditions (compression, lighting)
- Shadow patterns ‚â† dirt accumulation (lighting analysis)
- Wear patterns ‚â† cleanliness issues (usage vs contamination)
- Reflective surfaces ‚â† staining (glare and reflection analysis)
